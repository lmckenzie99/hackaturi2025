      <h1>About Hack@URI</h1>
      <p>
        Hack@URI is the University of Rhode Island’s first-ever hackathon — a
        celebration of creativity, technology, and collaboration coming this
        Spring! We’re a community of students passionate about creating spaces
        where others can learn by building — whether it’s coding, design,
        business, or exploring bold new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to bridge the gap between classroom learning and
        real-world experience. By bringing together students from all majors,
        we aim to spark innovation, inspire problem-solving, and connect
        participants with Rhode Island’s growing tech and creative community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re a first-time hacker or a seasoned builder, Hack@URI is
        your chance to learn something new, meet amazing people, and make
        something you’re proud of.
      </p>
